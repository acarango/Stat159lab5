Task1: Write a few lines on / Draw what is happening here?

What's happenening here is we are using github correctly. One user pushes changes they make locally and the other pulls them so both users' local repos match the remote one.

Task2: Why do you see a conflict? How do you resolve this conflict?

There is a conflict because there was a change pushed by user a on file2 before user b attempted to push changes. User b therefore does not have some work locally that is on the remote repo. We resolve this by having user b pull the changes from github before pushing.
