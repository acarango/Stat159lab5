USER A: Austin Carango

USER B: Cheng Peng

Task1: Write a few lines on / Draw what is happening here?

What's happenening here is we are using github correctly. One user pushes changes they make locally and the other pulls them so both users' local repos match the remote one.

Task2: Why do you see a conflict? How do you resolve this conflict?

There is a conflict because there was a change pushed by user a on file2 before user b attempted to push changes. User b therefore does not have some work locally that is on the remote repo. We resolve this by having user b pull the changes from github before pushing.

Task3: What is going on here?

We are working in branches which we can merge with master. This means we can make chamges to the master via a branch without having them synced.

Task4: What is going on here?

Both users are on different branches editing different files, so there are no issues which require pulling.

Task5: What about now?

Here we are working on the same file so user a runs into an error which requires him to pull before pushing.
